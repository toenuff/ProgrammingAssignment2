## This code is the week 3 homework for the Intro to R Programming Course on Coursera via Johns Hopkins
## It contains a bit of code that implements a caching function to store the inverse of a matrix so that
## a cached copy is created on first use and is then used in each subsequent call to inverse the matrix


## This is the function that caches the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    print("success")
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    print("success")
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
